## quartermaster

## endpoints
* Client `http://localhost:8080/index.html`
* REST API `http://localhost:8080/api/dashboards`
* Actuator API `http://localhost:8090/`

## building

### bundling the client with quartermaster
Build `infiniboard-app` before doing one of the next steps and the client will be automaticly bundled into quartermaster.  

### build quartermaster for production usage
```
$ ../gradlew clean build
```

### build quartermaster docker container
```
$ ../gradlew clean buildDocker
```

### build continuously while developing
Open a terminal and run:
```
$ ../gradlew clean build
$ ../gradlew -t classes
```

Open another terminal and start the application:
```
$ cd quartermaster
$ ../gradlew bootRun
```

Now all changes are reloaded live.
