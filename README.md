# infiniboard
infiniboard is a customizable, general purpose project dashboard to assist you in gathering your most important project metrics in one place.


## local development

Remove all existing IntelliJ project configurations and create the latest one by running:
```
$ ./gradlew cleanIdea idea
```

### infiniboard-app
If you do not have node/npm set up globally, setup a local installation by running:
```
$ ./gradlew -Pdownload_node npmSetup
$ ./gradlew -Pdownload_node npmInstall
```

otherwise just run:
```
$ npm install
```

To start the client in development mode run:
```
$ node node_modules/.bin/gulp dev
```

To package the client for production usage run:
```
$ node node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

The package client is located inside the `build` directory.


### quartermaster
Open a terminal and start a gradle deamon that builds continuously:
```
$ cd quartermaster
$ ../gradlew buildWithClient
$ ../gradlew -t classes
```

Open another terminal and start the application:
```
$ cd quartermaster
$ ../gradlew bootRun
```

Now all changes are reloaded live.
