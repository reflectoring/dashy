# infiniboard
infiniboard is a customizable, general purpose project dashboard to assist you in gathering your most important project metrics in one place.


## local development

Remove all existing IntelliJ project configurations and create the latest one by running:
```
$ ./gradlew cleanIdea idea
```

### quartermaster
Open a terminal and start a gradle deamon that builds continuously:
```
$ ./gradlew -t classes
```

Open another terminal and start the application:
```
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

Now all changes are reloaded live.

#### disable embedded mongo db
To disable the embedded mongo db use `-Pno_embedded_mongo` e.g.:
```
$ ./gradlew -Pno_embedded_mongo bootRun
```


### infiniboard-app
If you do not have node/npm set up globally, setup a local installation by running:
```
$ ./gradlew -Pdownload_node npmSetup
$ ./gradlew -Pdownload_node npmInstall
```

To start the client in development mode run:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

To package the client for production usage run:
```
$ npm install
$ gulp
```
The package client is located inside the `build` directory.
